## Logistic distribution

$$Q(u)=\ln\left(\frac{u}{1-u}\right)$$

## Generalized logistic distribution

Generalized Logistic Type I is also known as Burr II distribution

$$
Q(u)=-\ln\left(\frac{u^{\frac{1}{\delta}}}{u^{\frac{1}{\delta}}-1}\right)
$$

Generalized Logistic Type II

$$
Q(u)=-\ln\left(\frac{1-(1-u)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{(1-u)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}\right)
$$
